# Bevy N-Body (2D)

A poorly made n-body simulation; my first time using Bevy

It's heavily based on [this project](https://github.com/WhoisDavid/bevy-nbody), but I tried to simplify things so that I actually knew what was going on

Next steps would be to add a UI, allowing a user to pause the simulation and manipulate bodies
